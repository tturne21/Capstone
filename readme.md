## Overview
This capstone project delves into the realm of data analysis to explore the possibility of creating a nutritionally balanced fast-food diet. The project aims to leverage data-driven insights to address the challenge of meeting Minimum Daily Recommended Intakes (DRI) within the context of commonly available fast-food options. By examining nutritional data, assessing ingredients, and employing data analytics techniques, the project seeks to determine the feasibility of constructing a fast-food-based diet that aligns with established dietary guidelines.  In the initial brainstorming phase, a [MURAL persona](https://app.mural.co/t/tianat1681/m/tianat1681/1696990311419/7e4ccf388b58153517dc1b73265af2ad6988e781?sender=u947b1cc7aae55128a6989997) was created to represent the target audience or user base, guiding the project's direction towards meeting their needs and preferences.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze nutritional information from 13 fast-food chains and menu items.
- Apply data analytics methodologies to evaluate nutritional content and identify patterns.
- Design algorithms to optimize food combinations that meet or exceed Minimum DRI.
- Explore the feasibility and sustainability of a balanced fast-food diet for individuals with hectic lifestyles.

## Technologies Used
- Data Collection & Cleaning: Excel for initial data cleaning and structuring.
- Querying & Database Creation: SQL for creating structured CSV files and simple queries.
- Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Itertools, Tabula) for EDA, algorithm design, and data conversion.
- Visualization: Tableau for creating insightful and interactive visualizations.

## Methodology
The methodology involved an extensive review of nutritional information from 13 fast-food chains, including Chipotle, McDonald's, Subway, Wendy's, Burger King, and several others. The analysis focused on evaluating menu combinations and nutritional data to determine the potential for meeting Minimum Daily Recommended Intakes (DRI) across various establishments.

1. Data Collection: Gathered and cleaned nutritional information from diverse sources.
2. Data Structuring: Used Excel for preliminary data cleaning and SQL for structuring CSV files.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed Python for in-depth analysis, algorithm design, and data manipulation.
4. Visualization: Utilized Tableau to visualize key insights and trends.

## Findings
### Key Findings
1. Chipotle's Balanced Menu Combinations: Out of the 13 assessed restaurants, Chipotle emerged as the sole provider offering various menu combinations meeting or exceeding Minimum Daily Recommended Intakes (DRI).
2. Industry-Wide Absence of Breakfast Options: A prevalent trend across all assessed restaurants was the absence of breakfast items, limiting the feasibility of creating comprehensive daily fast-food diet plans.

### Insights:
1. Chipotle's Uniqueness: Chipotle's menu diversity uniquely fulfilled nutritional requirements, yet the absence of breakfast items remained an industry-wide trend.
2. Opportunity for Industry Enhancement: The absence of breakfast offerings across all assessed restaurants signals an industry-wide gap, highlighting an opportunity for establishments to diversify their menus.

## Conclusion
The exploration encompassed an analysis of nutritional data from 13 diverse restaurants, revealing intriguing insights into the feasibility of crafting nutritionally balanced fast-food diets. Among the restaurants assessed, Chipotle emerged as the sole provider offering various menu combinations meeting or exceeding Minimum Daily Recommended Intakes (DRI). However, the broader investigation revealed a prevailing industry-wide trend of missing breakfast options across all assessed establishments.

This comprehensive exploration underscores the significance of leveraging data analysis in the fast-food industry to assess nutritional adequacy. While Chipotle showcased exceptional potential in fulfilling dietary requirements, the absence of breakfast options remains a prevalent gap within the industry. Additionally, the missing drink data across the assessed restaurants emphasizes the need for comprehensive datasets to create thorough nutritional assessments.

The findings highlight both the success and limitations of current offerings within the fast-food landscape. Moving forward, efforts to address industry-wide gaps, collaborate for validation, and refine dietary recommendations are imperative for the continued evolution and enhancement of fast-food nutritional offerings.

### Recommendation
For individuals seeking a fast-food diet aligned with nutritional requirements, Chipotle emerges as a commendable choice. Among various assessed establishments, Chipotle stands out as the sole provider offering menu combinations meeting or exceeding Minimum Daily Recommended Intakes (DRI). Despite the absence of breakfast options, Chipotle's diverse menu and commitment to transparent nutritional information make it a favorable choice for those aiming for balanced fast-food choices. Consider exploring Chipotle's menu combinations throughout the day to ensure a more comprehensive and nutritionally balanced fast-food diet.

## Next Steps
### Immediate Steps:
- Incorporate Breakfast Options: Research and integrate breakfast items from various sources to supplement the morning meal, addressing the absence of breakfast options in the analyzed restaurants.
- Refine User Dietary Input Integration: Further develop code functionality to seamlessly integrate user dietary preferences, allowing for personalized recommendations within the fast-food diet plans.
- Enhance Menu Analysis: Expand the dataset to include missing drink data, ensuring a more comprehensive nutritional assessment for the analyzed restaurants.
### Future Directions:
- Collaborate for Validation: Consider collaborating with nutritionists or health professionals to validate the nutritional adequacy of the generated fast-food diet plans.
- Explore Additional Restaurants: Extend the analysis to include more restaurants, broadening the scope to assess a wider variety of fast-food options and their nutritional completeness.
- Iterative Refinement: Continuously refine algorithms and models based on insights gathered from expanded datasets and user feedback, ensuring the continuous enhancement of the dietary recommendations.
